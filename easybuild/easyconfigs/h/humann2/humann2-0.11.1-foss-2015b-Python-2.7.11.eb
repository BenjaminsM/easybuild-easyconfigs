and abundance of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequencing 
data (typically millions of short DNA/RNA reads). This process, referred to as functional profiling, 
aims to describe the metabolic potential of a microbial community and its members. More generally, 
functional profiling answers the question "What are the microbes in my community-of-interest doing 
(or capable of doing)"""
